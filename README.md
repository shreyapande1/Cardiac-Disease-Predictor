Problem Setting:
• Identifying and targeting high-risk individuals for preventative measures and
interventions, such as lifestyle changes and medications, in order to reduce the overall
cost of healthcare.
• Developing and promoting preventative health programs, such as fitness and nutrition
programs, to help individuals manage their PKIs and reduce their risk of heart disease.
• Utilizing PKIs to improve the effectiveness of healthcare services and treatments by
identifying individuals who are at high risk for heart disease and targeting them for early
intervention.
• Developing new products and services, such as mobile health apps and wearable
technology, to help individuals track and manage their PKIs.
• Improving the accuracy and reliability of PKIs with advanced diagnostic tools and
technologies, such as genetic testing and machine learning.
• Reducing the overall costs of healthcare by identifying and managing individuals with
risk factors for heart disease early on, which can help to prevent more costly and serious
complications in the future.
• Improving the population health through the prevention and management of heart
disease.

Dataset Description:
The dataset contains health-related information for several individuals, including their heart
disease status, body mass index (BMI), smoking and alcohol habits, history of stroke, physical
and mental health ratings, walking ability, gender, age group, race, diabetes status, physical
activity level, general health rating, sleep time, and history of asthma, kidney disease, and skin
cancer.
Further, this dataset could be used for various health-related analyses and modeling, we’ll be
using it for predicting heart disease risk based on other features or exploring the relationships
between different health factors.


Data Exploration:
Data mining tasks for Personal Key Indicators (PKIs) of heart disease may include:
Data cleaning and preprocessing: removing missing values, outliers and irrelevant data, and
transforming the data into a format that can be easily analyzed.
Exploratory data analysis: understanding the distribution, patterns, and relationships in the
data, and identifying any trends or anomalies.
Feature selection and extraction: identifying the most relevant and informative features from
the data that can be used to predict heart disease risk.
Model development and evaluation: building and evaluating predictive models using
techniques such as decision trees, logistic regression, or machine learning algorithms.
Model deployment: implementing the model in a production environment, where it can be
used to identify high-risk individuals and target them for interventions.

Classification:
• Logistic Regression: A simple, linear model that can be used to predict binary outcomes
based on a set of input features.
• Decision Trees: A tree-based model that can be used to make decisions based on a set
of input features.
• Random Forest: A type of decision tree algorithm that creates multiple trees and
combines their output to improve the overall performance of the model.
• Gradient Boosting: A machine learning algorithm that creates an ensemble of decision
trees, it improves the performance of the model by combining the predictions of
multiple weak models.

Performance Evaluation:
We ran various classifications algorithms to predict categorical outcomes in our case i.e. to
predict if a person has heart disease or not. To evaluate the evaluation of our model we ran a
bunch of evaluation metrics. Here is a summary of these metrics.
